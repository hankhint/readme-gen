## Walkthrough Video
This video demonstrates the functionality of the app with Rick Astley lyrics.  Due to a plugin in my developer environment, some of the links in the generated ReadME don't work correctly.  This issue is related to my local machine and should not be a problem on other systems.

## Technology Used
The following necessary dependencies must be installed to run the application properly:
- Node.js to display the inquirer prompmts and to populate the the ReadME template https://nodejs.org/en/
- inquirer to collect user input to populate the ReadME template https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer
- fs to use the file system to create the ReadME file

## How to Use
You need Node.js install to run this application.  After you have Node.js installed, download the files from the repository and run "npm install" to install the dependencies.  Run "npm index" to start the application. Answer the prompts, choose your project's license and check your /dist folder to see the readme file you created.  You may need to use a text editor to view the readme's markdown format, as sometimes a browser will have you "download" the file repeatedly instead of displaying the content.
 
## License
The application uses the MIT license.
